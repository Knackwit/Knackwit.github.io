        "I build becuase I want my children to know their Father is present,
        engaged, and fullfilled in all his efforts. Children know when their
        parents are happy in only a portion of their lives. And it's a heavey
        burden to cary. I build to leave things better in my wake, and my kids
        will know that is my calling. And they will know they'll find a calling
        of their own."
