        "I'm almost 40, I have two children under 3, and I'm lucky enough to have<br>
        recently found my calling (even at this age it's a gift), and I've been<br>
        teaching myself to code for a little over 3 months now. I devote my<br>
        meager "free time" to studying syntax, practicing algorithms, and building<br>
        web apps. I am always tired, always full of uncertainty and anxiety<br>
        regarding the state of the world and what kind of life my kids will be<br>
        able to have, but I know what I want and I'm working toward it every day.<br>
        And I'm happy (when I'm not terrified), and do my best to accept how<br>
        little control I actually have, while pouring all of myself into my family<br>
        and this new path...and maybe 20 mins of video games here and there :)<br>
        I'm one of the lucky ones, and grateful every day."
